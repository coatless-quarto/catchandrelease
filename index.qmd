## Usage

It's important to note that the `catchandrelease` extension doesn't introduce any significant improvements to your document content. Instead, it serves as a valuable example of how to identify, retrieve, and place flagged content.

## Installation

To install the `catchandrelease` extension, open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/catchandrelease
```

This command will download and install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you're using version control, make sure to include this directory in your repository.


# Fin

By using these techniques, you can efficiently re-organize content inside of Quarto.
