title: "Catch and Release Example"
filters:
  - catchandrelease
---

This filter is designed to extract the text from the following code blocks:

```{test-python}
1 + 1
```

```{test-r}
print("hello")
```

```{test-empty-return}

```

```{test-v2}
sd(c(1,2,3))
```

```{test-multiline}
x = c(1,2,3)

mean(x)
```

```{test-empty}
```

Once the code is extracted, the filter will then insert at the end of the document the lines of code via `JSON`.
